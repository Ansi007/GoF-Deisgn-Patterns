Q: Command?

In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform
an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.  

The command pattern should be used when: You need a command to have a life span independent of the original request, or if you want to queue, specify and execute
requests at different times. You need undo/redo operations. The command's execution can be stored for reversing its effects.
